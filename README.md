## Changes with large effect on diffs in default config
- Daemon `v0.55.2-161-gf27fdce5f`: Default overbright bits changes 2->1. `r_overbrightBits` replaces `r_overbrightDefaultClamping`
- Daemon `v0.55.2-129-g991a688d7`: `r_tonemap` later known as `r_toneMapping` added

## Changes with smaller effect or requiring non-default cvars
- Daemon `v0.55.1-33-g356efc547`(ish): `r_bloom` does something again
- Daemon `v0.55.1-20-gc75086661` and parent: overbright works differently; half-float color buffer
